Exercise 1: Understanding Cloud Computing Models
1. Objective: Explore different cloud computing models and understand their key
differences.
2. Steps:
○ Research the three primary cloud service models: Infrastructure as a Service
(IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).
Answer:
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS): A set of raw IT resources offered to the user by the cloud service provider. They can be used to virtualise an infrastructure, or for resource-intensive projects — i.e. machine learning, big data, hosting, etc.
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS): A platform that a provider offers to its customers via the internet. It enables teams — especially developers — to build applications and software on a solution without having to maintain it. Some applications support a wide variety of programming languages, which means they deliver more flexibility than an application hosted on a local infrastructure.
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS): This is the most popular cloud service. It is software that runs on a provider’s infrastructure. The user pays for the license, but does not manage the data storage or physical hardware maintenance.

○ Create a table comparing these models in terms of control, flexibility, and use
cases.
Answer: 

Model
Control Level
Flexibility
Use Cases
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
High
High
Ideal for businesses that prefer to handle their own software applications, data management, middleware, and operating systems without worrying about the underlying hardware and networking infrastructure. This setup is typically used for creating virtual data centers, running complex software applications, and ensuring business continuity through disaster recovery solutions.
PaaS (Platform as a Service)
Medium
Medium
This solution is well-suited for developers aiming to create applications without managing the underlying infrastructure. It's typically used in various settings, such as development frameworks, analytics platforms, or business intelligence tools. Additionally, it plays a critical role in web hosting services, allowing developers to focus on building their solutions without the need to handle servers or other infrastructure components. It's a go-to choice when efficiency and scalability are priorities, making development faster and simpler
SaaS (Software as a Service)
Low
Low
Best for both end-users and businesses that want ready-to-go tools without the hassle of managing the backend. It’s commonly used for things like email services, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and collaboration tools. The appeal here is simplicity – you get a complete, functional product right out of the box, so there's no need to worry about servers, updates, or technical maintenance. It saves time and effort, letting users focus on their work instead of the tech behind it.
